# Where Now Explorer - Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Where Now Explorer is a kid-friendly location tracking web app built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The app successfully delivers on its core promise of helping families track their location and calculate distances to destinations. However, several critical improvements are needed to ensure the app is production-ready, accessible, and maintainable.

**Current Strengths:**
- Engaging, colorful UI perfect for families
- Clean service layer architecture
- Good error handling with user-friendly messages
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices
- First Nations land acknowledgment feature

**Key Areas Needing Attention:**
- No testing infrastructure
- ~~Accessibility gaps~~ âœ… COMPLETED - Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations needed
- TypeScript configuration too permissive

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority

#### 7. **Developer Experience**
**Problem:** Inconsistent code style, no automated checks
**Solution:** Implement development best practices
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up Prettier with config
- [ ] Add Husky for pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Enable all ESLint recommended rules
- [ ] Add commit message linting
- [ ] Create PR template
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD
**Effort:** 1 day
**Impact:** Medium - Improves code quality and consistency

#### 8. **Component Architecture**
**Problem:** Some components are too large and do too much
**Solution:** Refactor for better maintainability
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Split Index.tsx into smaller components
- [ ] Create custom hooks for complex logic
- [ ] Standardize component file structure
- [ ] Remove inline styles in favor of Tailwind
- [ ] Create component documentation
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Impact:** Medium - Easier to maintain and test

#### 9. **State Management Improvements**
**Problem:** Inefficient polling, no persistence
**Solution:** Optimize state management
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Pause location polling when tab is inactive
- [ ] Add localStorage persistence for preferences
- [ ] Implement destination history
- [ ] Cache geocoding results
- [ ] Add state debugging tools
**Effort:** 2 days
