2. **Duplicate error handling** in services (create base service class) âœ…
3. **Long parameter lists** in some functions (use option objects) âœ…
4. **Inconsistent error message formats** (standardize) âœ…
5. **Missing loading states** in some async operations âœ…

### Performance Optimizations:
1. **Image optimization** - Add WebP support with fallbacks

## Notes

- **Testing is the highest priority** - Without tests, future changes are risky
- **TypeScript strict mode** will reveal hidden bugs and should be done early
- **Production monitoring** is essential before any major feature additions
- Consider creating a public roadmap for transparency with users
- Maintain the playful, kid-friendly aesthetic in all new features
- Regular security audits should be scheduled quarterly
- Consider user feedback when prioritizing feature enhancements
