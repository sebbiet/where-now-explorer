# Where Now Explorer - Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Where Now Explorer is a kid-friendly location tracking web app built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The app successfully delivers on its core promise of helping families track their location and calculate distances to destinations. However, several critical improvements are needed to ensure the app is production-ready, accessible, and maintainable.

**Current Strengths:**
- Engaging, colorful UI perfect for families
- Clean service layer architecture
- Good error handling with user-friendly messages
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices
- First Nations land acknowledgment feature

**Key Areas Needing Attention:**
- No testing infrastructure
- ~~Accessibility gaps~~ âœ… COMPLETED - Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ~~Security considerations~~ âœ… COMPLETED - Comprehensive security hardening
- Performance optimizations needed (partially addressed with state management)
- TypeScript configuration too permissive

**Recent Improvements Completed:**
- âœ… **Accessibility Compliance** - Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and proper contrast
- âœ… **State Management** - Optimized polling, localStorage persistence, destination history, and caching
- âœ… **Error Handling & Recovery** - Retry logic, offline detection, fallback UI, and user-friendly recovery actions
- âœ… **Security Hardening** - Rate limiting, input sanitization, CSP headers, privacy controls, and API validation
